AUTHENTICATION & LOGIN SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE ANSWERS

================================================================
QUESTION 1: AUTHENTICATION METHOD
================================================================
Q: Are you using JWT tokens for authentication?
A: YES - Fully implemented and working
   - JWT token generation in auth.service.ts
   - Token verification middleware in auth.middleware.ts
   - Configurable expiry time (currently 1 hour)

Q: Do you have existing login/authentication endpoints in your backend?
A: YES - Complete authentication system exists
   - Login, register, refresh token endpoints all implemented
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Database integration ready

Q: What's the login flow?
A: email + password â†’ JWT token + user roles
   Flow:
   1. POST /api/users/login with {email, password}
   2. Server validates credentials against Master_UserProfile table
   3. Returns JWT token + user info + effective roles
   4. Client stores token for authenticated requests

================================================================
QUESTION 2: BACKEND API ENDPOINTS
================================================================

AUTHENTICATION ENDPOINTS (Public - No token required):
POST /api/users/login              - EXISTS - Enhanced with roles
POST /api/users/register           - EXISTS - Working
POST /api/users/refresh-token      - EXISTS - Structure ready
POST /api/users/forgot-password    - EXISTS - Structure ready
POST /api/users/reset-password     - EXISTS - Structure ready

CURRENT USER & PERMISSION ENDPOINTS (Protected - Requires JWT token):
GET  /api/users/me                 - NEW ENDPOINT - Get current user with roles
POST /api/users/check-permission   - NEW ENDPOINT - Check if user has specific role
GET  /api/users/effective-roles    - NEW ENDPOINT - Get user's effective roles
GET  /api/users/effective-roles/:userId - NEW ENDPOINT - Admin check any user's roles

USER MANAGEMENT ENDPOINTS (Protected):
GET  /api/users                    - EXISTS - Enhanced with role relations
GET  /api/users/query              - EXISTS - Advanced filtering with roles

LOGOUT:
- No server-side logout endpoint needed (JWT is stateless)
- Frontend handles logout by removing token from storage
- Optional: Implement token blacklisting if needed

================================================================
QUESTION 3: USER PROFILE INTEGRATION
================================================================

Q: Is Master_UserProfile your existing users table?
A: YES - This is your existing users table, now enhanced

Q: What fields does your user table have?
A: Complete field list:
   Core Identity:
   - id (primary key)
   - username (unique)
   - email (unique) 
   - mobile (unique)
   - password (hashed)

   Personal Info:
   - firstName, lastName
   - dateOfBirth, gender
   - permanentAddress, currentAddress
   - pan

   Professional Info:
   - department (relation to DepartmentEntity)
   - office (relation to OfficeEntity)
   - designation (relation to DesignationEntity)
   - employmentType (relation to EmploymentTypeEntity)
   - officerClass (relation to OfficerClassEntity)

   NEW - Roles & Groups (Enhanced):
   - roles (many-to-many with RoleEntity)
   - groups (many-to-many with GroupEntity)

Q: Do you need user registration functionality or just login?
A: BOTH implemented
   - Registration: Available for new user signup
   - Login: Primary authentication method
   - Admin can create users through user management interface

================================================================
QUESTION 4: ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)
================================================================

Q: Should I implement route guards based on roles?
A: YES - RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION:
   Backend provides:
   - JWT middleware for route protection
   - Permission checking endpoints
   - Role inheritance from groups

   Frontend should implement:
   - Angular guards using role checking
   - Route protection based on required roles
   - Automatic redirect to login if unauthorized

Q: Do you want component-level permission controls?
A: YES - IMPLEMENT THESE PATTERNS:
   Component Level:
   - Hide/show buttons based on roles
   - Disable form fields for read-only users  
   - Show different content based on permissions

Q: Should certain menu items be hidden based on user roles?
A: YES - RECOMMENDED MENU STRUCTURE:
   ADMIN: All menu items visible
   USER_MGR: User management, department-level data access
   DEPT_HEAD: Department-specific data, reports, team management
   FINANCE_MGR: Financial modules, budget planning, reports
   DATA_ENTRY: Data entry forms, basic CRUD operations
   VIEW_ONLY: Read-only access to assigned modules

================================================================
QUESTION 5: PERMISSION CHECKING
================================================================

Q: Should I create an Angular service that calls these backend endpoints?
A: YES - CREATE ANGULAR PERMISSION SERVICE:

   Backend Methods Available:
   - await permissionService.userHasRole(userId, "ADMIN")
   - await permissionService.userHasAnyRole(userId, ["ADMIN", "USER_MGR"])
   - await permissionService.getUserEffectiveRoles(userId)

   Angular Service Should:
   - Call GET /api/users/me on app startup
   - Call POST /api/users/check-permission for specific checks
   - Provide observable streams for role changes
   - Cache user permissions locally

Q: Do you want to cache user permissions in frontend for performance?
A: YES - RECOMMENDED CACHING STRATEGY:
   - Load user + roles on login
   - Store in Angular service/state management
   - Refresh on role changes
   - Clear on logout

================================================================
QUESTION 6: UI REQUIREMENTS
================================================================

Q: Do you want a separate login page or modal?
A: RECOMMENDATION: Separate Login Page
   - Better user experience
   - Easier to implement with routing
   - More secure (full page refresh clears state)

Q: Should I show user info (name, roles) in the header?
A: YES - IMPLEMENT USER INFO HEADER:
   - User name (firstName + lastName)
   - Current role/department
   - Dropdown with profile settings, change password, logout

Q: Do you need a "Change Password" functionality?
A: YES - IMPLEMENT CHANGE PASSWORD:
   - Current password verification
   - New password confirmation
   - Password strength requirements

Q: Should I add role management pages for admins?
A: YES - ADMIN ROLE MANAGEMENT INTERFACE:
   1. Roles Management
   2. Groups Management  
   3. User Management with role assignments

================================================================
QUESTION 7: EXISTING CODE ENHANCEMENT
================================================================

Q: Should I enhance existing files or create new ones?
A: ENHANCE EXISTING + ADD NEW:

ENHANCE EXISTING FILES:
   auth.service.ts - Add role-based methods
   auth.guard.ts - Enhance with role-based guards
   auth.interceptor.ts - Handle JWT and 401 responses
   Login/Register Components - Add role handling

CREATE NEW FILES:
   permission.service.ts - Handle all permission checking
   role-guard.service.ts - Route guards based on roles
   user-profile.component.ts - Show user info with roles
   role-management/ - Admin role management interface

================================================================
QUESTION 8: SAMPLE ROLES INTEGRATION

SECTORS/SUB-SECTORS:
   - ADMIN: Full CRUD access
   - USER_MGR: Full CRUD access
